Introduction

The basic idea of diaGrabber is shown in the following image and will be described now.

.. image:: _static/idea_of_diaGrabber.png

Imagine to have some data, maybe stored in a file or generated trough a stream. ``diaGrabber`` calls this **source**.
Each source includes values sorted in **basis-** and **mergeDimensions**.

basisDimension
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
...counter

mergeDimension
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
...


The values of the source were stored in a **target** which is usualy a matrix. See mod::`diaGrabber.target._matrix.matrixBase` for more information.
It is possible to filter the values before they are stored in a target.
Some of those filters are:
	* **include**
	* ...

It is also possible to process the values via:
	* **calc**
	* **transform**

.......

To get all possible functions of a module you can have a look at the Application programming interface of diaGrabber at :ref:`api`.
Another possibility is to (install and) open an interactive python-shell, like `iPython <http://ipython.org/>`_ or `IDLE <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDLE_(Python)>`_ 
and to import diaGrabber in it via::

	import diGrabber
	diaGrabber.

and then pressing the **[TAB]-key** shows all possible classes and functions including its `docstrings <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/>`_.

To import all necassary moduls directly type::

	from diaGrabber import source, target, plot
	from diaGrabber.source.methods import merge, calc, exclude, transform
