To get all possible functions of a module you can have a look at the Application programming interface of diaGrabber at :ref:`api`.
Another possibility is to open an interactive python-shell, like `iPython <http://ipython.org/>`_ or `IDLE <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDLE_(Python)>`_ 
and to import diaGrabber in it via::

	import diGrabber
	diaGrabber.

and then pressing the **[TAB]-key** shows all possible classes and functions including its `docstrings <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/>`_.
