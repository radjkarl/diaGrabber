**diaGrabber** -> read, process, plot, automate
==============================================================================
``diaGrabber`` is a module fully written in `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_.
Its main benefits are:

* no restriction to 2- or 3-dimensional problems
* handle unstructured data
* no limitation of the size of source-files
* interactive visualization of the readout of sources
* compair and connect multiple source-files (also of different file-types like plainText or libreOfficeCalc)
* fully automatable
* powerfull options to manipulate and filter values
* inter-/extrapolate between given points

* `ooolib <https://sourceforge.net/projects/ooolib/>`_ (to read from open-/libreOffice-calc)
* `numpy/scipy <http://www.scipy.org/Download>`_ (Python modules for numeric and scientific problems)
* `bottleneck <http://berkeleyanalytics.com/bottleneck/>`_ (superfast NaN-array-handling)
